################# IMPORTANT SCRIPT INFORMATION ################# 

By Default the variables will log the finding to the the asset's activity log. Toggle the coorspending variable to have the script
take actions or creating a RMM Alert, or to force add the found packages to the choco update list. I added as much information into 
the RMM Alert, Write-Host Outputs, and Asset Activity Log as I could so it is very clear whats was found.

This script works in seperately from a Syncro 3rd Party Patch Policy. Neither parts interact or would conflict. BUT you need to
run your own schedule for the update all choco packages. Command Prompt command is:

choco upgrade all -y

You would need to run this commandon a scheduled script or other method, to have the packages found by this script to update.
This script will add the packages to the list of chocolatey managed packages on the machine, but it does not run the 
updates on any kind of schedule. Command Prompt command to see your current choco package list:

choco list

Update the $packages hasttable in the powershell code to add or remove the software's installed display name and the
corresponding package in chocolatey.

Like all things in the IT world, there is no guarantee all the pAlready Managed Packages ackages listed are the correct and one you actually would want,
and/or if the Package Name gets changed or  updated to something different in the future. But I tried to keep the list only
the largest,most commonly know packages and software. Feel free to research and add additional packages as appropriate.


################# Additional Considerations about Chocolatey ################# 

For Many common installers (e.g., Zoom, Chrome) Chocolatey usually detect an existing installation and upgrade it without uninstalling and
reinstalled but this isn't universal. Some Chocolatey packages might work differently,  behavior can vary by software vendor. 
It's best to check the choco package's documentation or test on a non-critical system if you're concerned for any issues.

https://community.chocolatey.org/packages

Any software that has a matching Chocolatey package can be added to the choco update list (type in command prompt: "choco list" to
see your machines current list) but the tricky part is matching up the reported Display Name of installed software with the official
choco package name. If you are not careful you can easily make mistakes here.
